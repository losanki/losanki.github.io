>This have I gained today, this whim I'll satisfy, this
wealth is mine and much more too will be mine as time
goes on. He was an enemy of mine, I've killed him, and
many another too I'll kill. I'm master here. I take my
pleasure as I will; I'm strong and happy and successful.
I'm rich and of good family. Who else can match himself
with me? I'll sacrifice and I'll give alms: why not? I'll have
a marvelous time! So speak fools deluded in their
ignorance. (Bhagavad Gita 16:13-15)
